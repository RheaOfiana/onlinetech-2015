		It wasnt yet dawn when I woke up. I raised my gaze to the darkened sky an angry mess of swirling clouds, smeared with streaks of golden to the east. A cold wind gushed in my ear, whipping strands of stray black hair across my forehead.
		<br>
		<br>
I got up, ignoring the waves of fatigue racking my body. A quick look around told me I was on a huge boulder perched precariously atop a hill. I had little memory of how I got there, but that didnâ€™t matter. I could work things out as I moved.

<br>

I took a step forward, but the pain in my chest made me bend over, panting. With my left hand on my knee, I wiped the sweat from my brow and looked up. There was a pink fringe above the distant hills that announced the arrival of a new day. I trudged down the hill slope, one painful step at a time. A straggling band of pine trees gave me company along the way, thinning out as I descended.

Daylight was advancing with haste. The wind had grown to a gale so strong that it made the pines in the forest sway, and my long overcoat flap loudly behind me as I trundled on. The birds screeched and wailed above, seeking shelter from the approaching storm.
	<br>
	<br>
The trail beneath me had gotten wider, now covered with a thick green carpet of dew-laden moss. I walked on, my moccasins a whisper on the cobblestones. I heard a bell chiming in the distance, heralding the arrival of a new day.
